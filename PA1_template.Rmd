## Loading and preprocessing the data

Project data was supplied as a zip file `activity.zip` which was unzipped
manually to yield `activity.csv`.  This gets loaded using `read.csv()`.

```{r dataLoad}
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)

# The 'stringsAsFactors' bit makes the date field a string, which may be
# a bit silly.
# columns are date, interval, steps)
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

We massage the data a bit to make processing simpler.

```{r dataPrep}
# This doesn't get used exactly in this form.
naMap <- is.na(data$steps)	# a vector of 17568 elements, 2304 of them TRUE

# hour is zero-based, slot is one-based :-(
data2          <- mutate(data, 
                   hour = as.integer((0.001 + interval) / 100),
                   slot = 1 + (interval %% 100) / 5 )

data3          <- select(data2, date, hour, slot, steps)
data3$date     <- as.Date(data3$date)

avgBySlot      <- select(data3, slot, steps) %>%
                  group_by(slot)             %>% 
                  summarize(meanSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

avgByHour      <- select(data3, hour, steps) %>%
                  group_by(hour)             %>% 
                  summarize(meanSteps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

# DEBUG
avgPerSlot     <- mean(avgBySlot$meanSteps)
avgPerDay      <- 288 * avgPerSlot
# END

```

So the average number of steps in any given slot is `r avgPerSlot`, which 
gives an average of `r avgPerDay` steps per day.

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


```{r histogram}

perDay         <- select(data3, date, steps) %>% 
                  group_by(as.factor(date))  %>%
                  summarize(totalSteps=sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

ggplot(data=perDay, aes(totalSteps)) 	           +
    xlab('Steps per Day') 		           +
    ylab('Number of Days with That Number of Steps')	   +
    ggtitle('Steps per Day in Period of Interest') +
    geom_histogram(bins=100)

meanStepsPerDay     <- mean(perDay$totalSteps)
medianStepsPerDay   <- median(perDay$totalSteps)
meanSteps   <- sprintf("%.0f", meanStepsPerDay)
medianSteps <- sprintf("%.0f", medianStepsPerDay)

```

The figure above shows how many days in the period of interest have step
counts in various ranges (buckets).  

The mean number of steps per day is `r meanSteps` and the median is 
`r medianSteps`.  These numbers suggest that the subject of the experiment
is attempting to hit the magic target of ten thousand steps a day.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

The 'average daily activity pattern' is understood here to be the average 
for each of the 5-minute intervals 
across all 60 or so days in the period
for which we have data.  There are 288 = 12x24 such 5-minute intervals in each
day; this is the number on the x-axis in the graph.  There is a sharp peak in
activity just after the 100th interval, which is around 500 minutes into the 
day, suggesting that the subject went walking or running at around 08:20 in
the morning.

```{r dailyActivity}

# Add a column converting hour and slot to 'daySlot', the [1..288] index 
# of this particular 5-minute slot in the day

data4  <- mutate(data3, daySlot= (hour * 12) + slot)

data5  <- select(data4, daySlot, steps) %>% 
          group_by(daySlot)             %>%
          summarize(meanSteps = mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

plot(data5$daySlot, data5$meanSteps, type='l', 
       main='Typical Daily Activity (Steps)',
       xlab='5-minute interval [1:288]',
       ylab='Average Number of Steps in Interval')

maxMeanSteps <- max(data5$meanSteps)

```

The maximum average number of steps in any 5-minute interval was 
`r sprintf("%.2f" , maxMeanSteps)`.

## Imputing missing values

### Calculate and Report Total Number of Missing Values
```{r imputation}

nbrMissing <- sum(is.na(data$steps))

```

There were `r nbrMissing` missing values (NA step counts) in the dataset.

### Devise a Strategy for Filling in Missing Values

The simplest approach to filling in any missing values is to just replace any
NA values with the average number of steps per 5-minute interval for the 
entire dataset.

```{r AvgStepsPerInterval}

avgStepsPerInterval <- meanStepsPerDay / 288


```

### Create a New Dataset With Missing Values Replaced

```{r imputing}

data6 <- data3			# copy the date-hour-slot-steps data frame
data6$steps[is.na(data6$steps)] <- avgStepsPerInterval

```

### Make a Histogram of Total Steps Taken Each Day

```{r histogram2}

perDay2         <- select(data6, date, steps) %>% 
                  group_by(as.factor(date))  %>%
                  summarize(totalSteps=sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

ggplot(data=perDay2, aes(totalSteps)) 	           +
    xlab('Steps per Day') 		           +
    ylab('Number of Days with That Number of Steps')	   +
    ggtitle('Steps per Day in Period of Interest') +
    geom_histogram(bins=100)

meanStepsPerDay2     <- mean(perDay2$totalSteps)
medianStepsPerDay2   <- median(perDay2$totalSteps)
meanSteps2   <- sprintf("%.0f", meanStepsPerDay2)
medianSteps2 <- sprintf("%.0f", medianStepsPerDay2)

```

### Calculate and Report Mean and Median

After imputing missing values, the mean number of steps per day is 
`r meanSteps2` and the median is `r medianSteps2`.  

### Effect of Imputing on Estimates of Total Daily Steps

Imputing missing data increased the mean and median steps per day by a 
significant amount, in fact by more than 10%.  This is largely because the
NAs were not randomly distributed.  In fact in the activity data set all
of the `steps` values for the first and last days were NA.  In practical
use these two days should have been simply ignored.  


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
